WooCommerce reporting extension to elegantly display customer orders by location.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a new section in the WooCommerce Reports -> Orders area called 'Sales by location'.

The report visualizes the customer purchases by location into a Choropleth map to show where your orders are being placed.

* Display by shipping address or billing address
* Display by number of orders or order amount.

= Get involved =

Developers can contribute to the source code on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/chuckmac/woocommerce-location-report).


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The sales report says I have more orders in the time period than the location report shows... why? =
